# Siftly

**Siftly** is a lightweight insights engine that helps product teams, developers, and founders understand real user feedback from Reddit and other public sources.

It uses Reddit‚Äôs public API to:

- üîç Search for user posts related to any product, feature, or topic
- üí¨ Analyse sentiment using open-source NLP models (VADER)
- üìä Score and organise pain points, feature requests, and common complaints

Siftly is designed to help early teams catch recurring user issues without needing a full customer support system or expensive analytics stack.
